# Self Driving Course Exercise - Udemy
This repository is my hands on experience of Applied Deep Learning to drive an automated car in Carla Simmulator.

It is learnt, guided and inspired by Udemy course: [The Complete Self-Driving Car Course - Applied Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/applied-deep-learningtm-the-complete-self-driving-car-course/)

It is a great course by Rayan Slims, just like others courses he has taught well, justice was done to this course too.

P.S It was on sale when I got it, however I encourage you to buy it too. :D

<!-- Following is jist of what I learnt from the course. -->

## Finding lanes in a picture

## FInding lanes in a video

## Perceptron
