# Self Driving Course Exercise - Udemy

This repository is my hands on experience of Applied Deep Learning to drive an automated car in Carla Simulator.

It is learnt, guided and inspired by Udemy course: [The Complete Self-Driving Car Course - Applied Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/applied-deep-learningtm-the-complete-self-driving-car-course/)

It is a great course by Rayan Slims, just like others courses he has taught well, justice was done to this course too.

P.S It was on sale when I got it, however I encourage you to buy it too. :D

<!-- Following is gist of what I learnt from the course. -->

## Finding lanes in a picture

## Finding lanes in a video

## Perceptron

### Sigmoid function and calculating probabilities

It is used to calculate likeliness of point lying close to the current line of classification. The area under the line will show positive region and above the line will be negative region.

Further point and positive region: give higher probability.
Further point and negative region: give low probability.

For correct classification of data, we will use class entropy.

### Class Entropy

### Gradient Descent

## Keras

It does all the dirty work for us; predictions (Which were done in previous section).

## Deep Neural Network.

What if it's not a linear model? What if we need a curve to classify points?

We will use deep neural networks with hidden layers.

Note: To play with deep neural network, you can go to playground.tensorflow.org.

## Multiclass Classification

We are using softmax.
